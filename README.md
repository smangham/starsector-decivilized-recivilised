# Decivilized Recivilised

`v1.0.0` for Starsector `0.96a-RC10`, made using [Wisp's IntelliJ Mod Template](https://github.com/wispborne/Starsector-IntelliJ-Template)

## Description

A small mod that adds a project buildable at colonies with the **Decivilized Subpopulation** condition, that removes it.

## Installation

Download the latest `.zip` from the [Releases list](https://github.com/smangham/starsector-decivilized-recivilised/releases),
extract to the `starsector-decivilized-recivilised` directory, and place it in your `starsector/mods` directory then check it in the launcher.

## Usage

Any of your colonies with the **Decivilized Subpopulation** will now have **Clear Decivilized Subpopulation**
as a construction option under the *"Add industry or structure..."* menu.
It does not count towards a colony's Industry limit, and requires the colony have either of 
the **Ground Defenses** or **Heavy Batteries** structures. 

Once it finishes building, it will remove the **Decivilized Subpopulation** modifier, and then remove itself.

## Save Compatibility
* **Safe to add to an existing game** 
* **Safe to remove from an existing game:** Just make sure you've finished or cancelled construction of *"Clear Decivilized Subpopulation"*.

## FAQ
*"Why the mix of s and z?"* - S is more civilised.
